# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-various-ML-algorithms
Using a data set to detect any heart disease from the patientâ€™s current heart rate and warn the user of any potential heart failures.

Size of the dataset contains 304 rows with 14 attributes. 
We have used 5 algorithms - KNN, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, RANDOM FOREST, ANN and SVM. 
Algorithm which gives the best prediction is identified. 
A user friendly mobile application is developed and the best algorithm is used as a model in the mobile application.
